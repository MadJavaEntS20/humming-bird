# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles. 


### Week 2

1/28/2020 - 6 hours

Tasks Completed:

 * completed week 2 activities and exercises
 * some brainstorming on Independent project
 
Other Thoughts:

I need to do more thinking about the implementation of my project. From my work, I have a general idea of how this spatial data
will be stored in the database. Given time constraints most data that would be crowd-sourced will have to be dummy data.
